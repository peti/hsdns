This package provides bindings to the GNU adns library
<http://www.gnu.org/software/adns/> as well as an
appropriate high-level interface from the Haskell world. Not
all options are supported as of now, but you can do A, MX,
NS, and PTR lookups. The code has been tested with GNU adns
versions 1.0 and 1.1.
