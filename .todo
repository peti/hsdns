        Get rid of the unsafePerformIO crap in 'show.
        <comment>
            Done. We'll show the raw codes now. If you need
            better error messages, call adnsStrerror or
            friends yourself. All those functions are now in
            the IO monad, so I can't use them in show
            anymore.
